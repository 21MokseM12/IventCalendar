In this app, you can save all the memories of an event, including:

- The place or places where you and your friends spent time
- People who are dear to your heart
- A "madness level" to remember just how crazy you and your friends went during the event!

## Explanation

This app was created as a birthday gift for a close friend of mine. The interface is specifically designed for her, and I don't plan on changing it to maintain its personal touch. However, if you, dear reader, are okay with an interface that contains local memes from our group in Kaluga, I'd be happy to share my work!

## Enjoy!

If you've read this far and decided to try out the app, I wish you a pleasant experience!
